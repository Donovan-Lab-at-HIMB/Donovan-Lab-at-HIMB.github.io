### Mary Donovan
#### Principal Investigator

Dr. Mary Donovan is the principal investigator of the Donovan Lab and a tenure-track faculty member of the Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology at UH Mānoa. Dr. Donovan is a quantitative spatial ecologist focused on applied questions that inform conservation and management of coupled human-natural systems. She studies coral reef status and trends by applying quantitative spatial science alongside practitioners and stakeholders who are implementing management and policy. Her research includes studies on complex ecological dynamics, local and global impacts on reefs, marine spatial planning, invasive species, fisheries, and ecological resilience.

### Morgan Pomeroy
#### PhD Student

Morgan Pomeroy is a PhD student in the Donovan Lab. She received her MSc in Marine Biology from the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, where she studied coral reef fish life history. She recieved a second MS in Geography from Arizona State University. Her research focuses on assessing how corals respond to the influence of local anthropogenic and environmental factors during large-scale heat stress events in Hawaiʻi and the Caribbean. In light of rising ocean temperatures, Morgan is interested in deepening understanding of how management intervention can foster coral reef resilience.

### Callie Stephenson
#### PhD Student

Callie Stephenson is a PhD student in the Donovan Lab. Her chief research interests are in the reciprocity of ecological systems - how fish communities interact with benthic communities and what place humans have in these interactions. As part of the socio-ecological community, Callie focuses on how management can help ecosystems function and provide ecosystem services. She recently finished her MSc in Marine Biology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in the Donahue Lab, and has previously worked on contract for the Division of Aquatic Resources and multiple conservation non-profits. Outside of our lab, you’ll also find her in the ocean as the Marine Science Supervisor at Mālama Pūpūkea-Waimea.

### Sherril Leon Soon
#### HIMARC Program Manager

Dr. Sherril Leon Soon is the Research Program Manager of our HIMARC (Hawaiʻi Monitoring and Reporting Collaborative) Core Team. She hails from Trinidad and Tobago, and has called Hawaiʻi home since 2007. Sherril earned a PhD in Oceanography from UH Mānoa. Her research focused on the biophysical interactions between algae and flowing water on multiple scales, investigating dissolved nitrogen dynamics. Sherril has long been an avid advocate for applied science, interdisciplinary work, and community engagement in research, and looks forward to participating in HIMARC’s education initiatives. She brings her Environmental Science and Oceanography backgrounds to HIMARC, as well as a genuine love for mentoring and supporting underrepresented groups.
