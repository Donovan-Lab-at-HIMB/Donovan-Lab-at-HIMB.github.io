The spirit of the lab is welcoming, kind, and empathetic. We love what we do and this is reflected in the quality of our work and the strength of our partnerships.

We value collaboration, and are supportive of one another. Our goal is to fight against competitiveness in academia, when one of us succeeds we all succeed. We support each other by encouraging creativity, being generous with our time and ideas, giving credit to each other for our contributions, and celebrating success for everyone in our lab and communities.

We are committed to openness and communication. We are available to one another, receptive to ideas and feedback, and attentive to each other’s needs.

Open science and integrity are vital to our work. We use tools and active approaches to better our interactions and our science, and we believe that openness is fundamental to the progression of science. We strive for transparency by sharing our data and work as openly as possible. We acknowledge that we have an important role as scientists and do not manipulate, steal, or disguise data or results.

We acknowledge our privileges and responsibilities. We use our privileges and responsibilities to serve the communities and ecosystems we work in.

The Donovan Lab creates an equitable, inclusive, and just space that fosters diversity. We recognize there are barriers in place that require restructuring and are working to make lasting change to increase diversity in the sciences through our actions. This is consistent with the [ASU Charter, Mission, and Goals](https://www.asu.edu/about/charter-mission-and-values) that we are “measured not by whom we exclude, but rather by whom we include and how they succeed.”

We respect each other, and we have ZERO tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or bullying by and/or of members of our community in any form. If we unknowingly hurt or offend a member of our lab or community we will listen, offer apologies, and commit to learning and doing better. Members of the lab and of our associated community who violate this code of conduct will be approached by Dr. Donovan. If necessary, the issue will be escalated to the relevant entities at Arizona State University. If you experience or observe a violation of this code of conduct, please contact Dr. Donovan. ASU also provides resources and other modes for reporting [here](https://inclusion.asu.edu/resources/reporting-options).
